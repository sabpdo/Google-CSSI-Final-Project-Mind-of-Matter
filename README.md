# Google-CSSI-Final-Project-Mind-of-Matter

In the Summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to attend Google's Computer Science Summer Institute as a scholar. Over these four weeks, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the last week, I was tasked to design and build a final collaborative project. My team and I decided to make a website focusing on mental health which we presented and demonstrated to Google employees and community leaders.
